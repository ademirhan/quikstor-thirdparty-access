# How To Create New Tenant

To create new tenant a user account needs to be created in QuikStor API application with an appropriate role permission to access and modify QuikStor data. We use account with 'login' and password token authentication. This can be viewed in the Login POST method located below:


If you're not familiar with the [Login or Authentication](https://quikstor.stoplight.io/docs/quikstor-thirdparty-access/docs/Authentication.md)  
Once you attain OAuth token as authentication using your username and password to [sign in,](https://quikstor.stoplight.io/docs/quikstor-thirdparty-access/reference/ThirdParty.v1.json/paths/~1login/post)
you'd be able to request [SiteId](https://quikstor.stoplight.io/docs/quikstor-thirdparty-access/reference/ThirdParty.v1.json/paths/~1api~1%3Cpartner-name%3E~1getsites/get)
