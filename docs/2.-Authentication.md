# Authentication

QuikStor use a standards-compliant [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authorization server. Our implementation also allows users to manage their own connections.

If you are new to OAuth, you can read more at [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net). 

The [authorization endpoint]() and the [token request](https://api-test.quikstor.com/quikstor_online_api/Quikstor.Online.Authorization/Provider/OAuthProvider) endpoint are linked. 


#### Access Token
To make calls from our API you will need an access token. To get an access token you need to go through the access token flow and prompt the user to authorize by logging into QuikStor. Access tokens can be requested per user login. 

To begin, you will need to send the user to the authorization endpoint. Hereâ€™s an example request:

username=email@quikstor.com&password=typepassword&grant_type=password

```json
{
  // Pass the username of the account
  "username": "email@quikstor.com",
  // Pass the password of the account
  "password": " ",
  // Pass the type of authorization
  "grant_type":password
  
}
```

#### Connections by HTTP and HTTPS

Access to the REST API uses HTTPS only by default. HTTP access is not permitted. Any attempt to access any of the API endpoints using HTTP will result in *403 Forbidden error*

You must configure HTTPS before attempting to access the API endpoints.
