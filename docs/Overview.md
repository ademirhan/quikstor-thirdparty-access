# QuikStor Third-Party API Documentation

The QuikStor API model will allow vendors to integrate QuikStor Cloud Application with any third-party self storage property management system. The API documentation gives you access to all supported functions of our service. The simple web requests over HTTP protocols (GET, POST and PUT methods) encoded in JSON or XML formatted data allows us to provide access to the system accross multiple platform and devices.

QuikStor API is a Hybrid between REST (Representational State Transfer) and customized API based cloud service for requesting data and sending data to our QuikStor database. 

Before getting started with the API there are a few things you as the developer should be familiar with.

- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON): All returned data objects are in this form by default.
: All returned data objects (except the AuthToken) can be in
this form if requested from the API.
- OAuth 2.0: API authorization is handled by OAuth validation and tokens. 

Provided below are web links to additional resources related to using the API.
